Abstract
Many students and recreational players want to stay active through sports but struggle to find reliable teammates, learn about team tryouts, or connect with coaches. Current solutions—such as Instagram posts or group chats are fragmented and unreliable. This leads to empty courts, missed tryout opportunities, and difficulty in maintaining consistent team rosters.
Our solution is Trego, a web-based platform designed to connect players, teams, clubs, and coaches in one place. Players can create profiles showcasing their sports, skill levels, and availability, while clubs and teams can post openings, schedule tryouts, and manage substitutions. Coaches can advertise lessons and allow players to book sessions directly. A reliability and reputation system ensures accountability, while matchmaking algorithms help users find compatible teammates or teams. By focusing on intent and trust (not generic social feeds) Trego provides a dedicated hub for building lasting sports connections.
Target Users: university students, recreational players, sports clubs, and coaches seeking to grow their networks or find new opportunities to play.
