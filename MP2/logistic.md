# 🚀 Trego — Design Project Milestone 2

## **Overview**
This milestone focuses on validating our idea through surveys and market analysis, producing design artifacts (Figma prototypes, architecture diagrams), and drafting technical planning documents. It consolidates all references (surveys, graphs, external docs) into one place.

## **1. Research & Validation**

### 📊 User Survey
- **Status**: Planned  
- **Goal**: Gather input on sports habits, challenges in finding players, and desired app features.  
- **Deliverable**: Survey results + analysis (will inform MVP priorities).

### 🌍 Market Analysis
- Compare existing solutions (TeamSnap, Spond, Meetup, intramural platforms).  
- Identify gaps in **reliability tracking**, **tryout scheduling**, and **substitute support**.  
- External research: sports tech trends, adoption barriers, pricing models.

- **Coverage**:
  - Profile creation  
  - Game discovery (map + filters)  
  - Tryout scheduling  
  - Substitution flow  
  - Attendance check-in

**Components:**
- **Frontend (Web)** → (TBD)  
- **Backend** → 
- **Database** → 
- **External APIs** → Google Maps + OpenStreetMap, Push Notifications  
- **Authentication** → OAuth2 / Firebase Auth

**Core Entities:**
- **User**: profile, availability, reliability score  
- **Team**: roster, open positions, history  
- **Game**: date/time, location, participants, waitlist  
- **Tryout**: requirements, evaluations, results  
- **Substitution**: request, fulfillment, reliability impact
