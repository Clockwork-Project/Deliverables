Abstract
Many students and community members want to play sports but struggle to find reliable teammates, open teams, or accessible tryouts. Current social platforms are either too general (e.g., instagram posts, facebook) or too fragmented (group chats, posters, word-of-mouth), making it difficult to coordinate casual games, join teams, or connect with coaches. This leads to empty courts, unfilled rosters, and missed opportunities to stay active.
Our solution is a location-based app that connects players, teams, clubs, and coaches. Players can create profiles that highlight their sports, skill levels, and availability, then use the app to find partners for pickup games or apply to open team positions. Clubs and teams can schedule tryouts, recruit new members, and manage substitutions, while coaches can advertise their services and book training sessions. By focusing on intent and reliability—not social feeds—our app provides a simple, dedicated platform for building real-world sports connections.
Target Users: university students, recreational players, sports clubs, and coaches looking to grow their teams or find new opportunities to play.
